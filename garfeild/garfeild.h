/*! \defgroup garfeild Garfeild: key points detection and matching

  This module depends on \ref starter and provides tools to detect key points,
  or feature points, and to match them against a set of trained model points.

  Garfeild is designed to quickly detect a planar object on an image. It is a
  two phases process: a training, or off-line phase, and an on-line phase.
  During training, \ref yape detects feature points on a model image. Patches
  are extracted, their orientation corrected, and their appearance learned. The
  \ref planar_object_recognizer::build_with_cache method takes care of the
  learning process.

  During the on-line phase, planar_object_recognizer calls yape to detect
  feature points on the input image. It establish matches with model points. It
  then run RANSAC to sort out bad and good matches, and to find an homography
  sending relating model and input points.

  \example filedetect.cpp
  This example shows how to train and use a planar object detector
