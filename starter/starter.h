  \section intro Introduction

  Bazar is a computer vision library based on feature points detection and
  matching. In particular, it is able to quickly detect and register known
  planar objects in images. It also contains a powerfull geometric and
  photometric camera calibration system.

  It is written and distributed at CVLab, EPFL -- http://cvlab.epfl.ch/

  \section install Installing Bazar

  BazAR depends on OpenCV (http://opencvlibrary.sourceforge.net/). You will
  need to install it before using BazAR. For OpenGL support, GLUT and GLEW are
  required (http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/ and http://glew.sourceforge.net/).

  \subsection unix_install UNIX/Linux

  Download bazar-xx.tar.gz. Run:
  tar -xzf bazar-xx.tar.gz
  cd bazar-xx
  ./configure
  make
  
  \subsection windows_install Windows

  Download the windows archive, run setup.exe and follow intructions.

  \section orga Library Organization

  Bazar is made of several modules, implemented in two libraries: 
  - \ref garfeild 
  - \ref starter

  \section Examples

  \example filedetect.cpp
  This example shows how to train and use a planar object detector

  \example singlecalib.cpp
  This interactive example shows how compute the geometric calibration of a
  single camera.

  \example augment3d.cpp
  When calibration is done, this example shows how basic 3D augmentation works.

  \example fullcalib.cpp
  This is a more complete example that computes geometric and photometric
  calibration and augmentation with a single camera.

  \example multicam.cpp
  A multi camera geometric and photmetric calibration example which depends
  only on OpenCV.

  \example multigl.cpp 
  A multi camera geometric and photometric calibration example, with OpenGL
  augmentation.
